# Urban Sound Recognition system

Data Mining and Machine Learning Project

The aim of our project was to create an application that allows users to determine the urban sounds around them. The application is able to automatically classify environmental noises according to their category. The classification part uses a machine learning algorithm to classify the correct category, selecting it from the most frequent categories.
